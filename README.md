# 🏠 Boston Housing Data Analysis

A data analysis project on the Boston housing dataset using Python, focusing on the relationship between the average number of rooms (`RM`), the percentage of lower-income population (`LSTAT`), and the median house price (`MEDV`).

---

## 📊 Project Objectives

- Explore the distribution of `RM`, `LSTAT`, and `MEDV`
- Use visualizations to understand variable relationships
- Calculate and interpret correlation coefficients
- Derive insights into how room count and income levels affect housing prices

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- 'pandas' for data manipulation  
- 'matplotlib' and 'seaborn' for data visualization  
- 'scipy.stats' to compute correlation coefficients

---

## 📌 Expected Outputs

- Histograms showing variable distributions  
- Boxplots identifying outliers  
- Scatter plots with regression lines  
- Correlation heatmap between selected variables
